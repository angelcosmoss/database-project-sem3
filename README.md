# database-project-sem3
Project name: Insurance Database System

This project was created using **SQLite (DB Browser for SQLite)**.  
The `.sql` files in this repository contain the queries we wrote for the project.  

Since the original `.db` file is no longer available, you can recreate the database by running the SQL scripts in any SQLite environment.
